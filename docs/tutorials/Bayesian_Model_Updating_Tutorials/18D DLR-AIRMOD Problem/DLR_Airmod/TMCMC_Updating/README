problemA_25_samples.m     the main file

problemA_tmcmc.m          this is the (general) TMCMC I sent you before (available in the folder /home/dalvarez/challenge/tmcmc)
                          modified for the sake of problem A. The modification is that the proposal PDF of the Markov Chain
                          is a TRUNCATED Multivariate Gaussian (so that we can respect the bounds on the parameters)

problemA_log_p_D_theta.m  the likelihood

problemA_p_theta_pdf.m    the prior PDF (a uniform PDF)

problemA_p_theta_rnd.m    a function that samples realizations from the prior PDF (that is from a uniform PDF)

myrand.m                  the one Matteo provided me (for circumventing the problem with the RNG).
